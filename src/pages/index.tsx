              EduMine is built on advanced machine learning capabilities. Once
              the student data has been encoded in to digital form. You can use
              EduMine to have a deeper understanding of a student both
              individually and as a class. EduMine's data analysis engine has
              two parts <b>The Prediction Engine</b> and{" "}

              In the image to the left we can see EduMine showing the prediction
              result of a student named Abigail Million. We can see from the
              graph that Abigail's score's has been decreasing from grade 7 to
              9, but from 9 to 12 her scores start increasing. The red dot on
              the graph shows the next year's predicted result which in this
              case shows that her scores will keep increasing. The x-axis on the
              graph shows the grade and they y-axis shows the scores. In the
              textual representation to the right of the graph we can see the
              exact percentages in which her score in each subject will
              increase.

              In the image to the left we can see EduMine showing the clustering
              result of all grade 11th students. Clustering allows us to group
              students based on two parameters. In this case the parameters are{" "}
              <b>online time</b> (the time a student spends online per week) and{" "}
              <b>Math</b> (the Math result of a student in the given year).
              Based on these parameters EduMine has separated the students in to
              four(4) clusters. The y-axis in the graph corresponds to online
              time and the x-axis corresponds to their Math score. Each point
              corresponds to a student. For example let's look at the yellow
              group, we can see that they scored low on their math tests and
              their online time is high. We can concluded that the time they
              spend online has impeded them from scoring high in the test.
